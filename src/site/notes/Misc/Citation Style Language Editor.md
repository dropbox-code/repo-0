# What is Citation Style Language?
According to the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_Style_Language) , **Citation Style Language** (**CSL**) is an open XML file format that describes schema for the formatting of citations and bibliographies. The reference management program using CSL include [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)(I am using), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), [Refworks](https://refworks.proquest.com/) and [Papers](https://www.papersapp.com/).
